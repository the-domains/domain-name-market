# **The Domains Which Chinese Domain Investors Like**

I mainly help our client looking for dot com, dot net and dot cn domains. These domains are Chinese investor prefer. Speak in more detail, here are the domain types we are looking for:

NN.COM

NNN.COM

NNL.COM

LNN.COM

LLN.COM

NNNN.COM

NNNNN.COM(without 0,4)

NNNNNN.COM(In good pattern, like 307777.com)

LL.COM

LLL.COM(without a,e,i,o,u,v)(with r,n,l may also make it less valuable in Chinese market)

LLLL.COM(mostly in bulk)

NN.NET

NNN.NET

NNNN.NET

LL.NET

LLL.NET

LLLL.NET

About numeric domains, without 0,4 is much better and valuable than those with 0,4\. 

If you have these types of domains, please feel free to contact me, my company will help you sell your domains to Chinese. 

Also, if you have other types domains for sale, please send me your domain list and i will keep you posted.

We also can help client looking for the domains they need, if you want to buy a good domain for yourself, we can help you!

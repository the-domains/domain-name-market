# **How to buy an premium domain belongs to Chinese domian investor in fair price**

As we all know that more and more premium dot com and dot net domains are owned by Chinese domain investors. What's more, most of them are brandable domains. Therefore, there will be more and more needs from western end users want to buy domains from Chinese investors.

The first rule is: do not contact the Chinese owner with the Whois email directly. If you do so, they will think that you are the end user, then the price i receive will be unbelievable high.

Before you try anything to buy the domain you want belongs to Chinese. You should be aware of the domain market price. There is no way you can get that domain under the market price. What this article can help you is only help you buy your dream domain around the Chinese domain market price instead of spending the end user price.

As the Chinese domain market changing so fast, so i am afraid that there is no one Chinese domain market price site can show the market correctly every day. So i am suggesting you to build up an good relationship with some Chinese domain broker. It will be helpful.

If you can use Chinese smoothly,then you don't need an Chinese friend 's help. You can contact the owner's QQ, phone, or email directly in Chinese. Then you should act like an Chinese domain investor, and then show your intention to buy this domain as investment.If you haven't learn Chinese, you may need to look for your Chinese friend for help, give them your budget and them let them help you to do that.
